### Example:

Suppose you have a CSV with columns A, B, and C. You want to create an SQL Table with two columns - "ID" and "MergedData," where "MergedData" contains values from both columns B and C. Here's how you would set it up:

-   Number of Columns: 2
-   Column 1:
    -   Name: ID
    -   Source Column: Select "A" from the dropdown menu.
-   Column 2:
    -   Name: MergedData
    -   Source Columns: Select both "B" and "C" from the dropdown menu.
-   In the source Handle Multiple source dropdown, select **Concatenate**

Similarly, you can duplicate the rows for 2 columns when populating a single destination column. Suppose you have a CSV with columns ID, Class 1, and Class 2. You want to create an SQL Table with two columns - "ID" and "Class," where "Class" contains values from either columns Class 1 or Class 2. Here's how you would set it up:

-   Number of Columns: 2
-   Column 1:
    -   Name: ID
    -   Source Column: Select "ID" from the dropdown menu.
-   Column 2:
    -   Name: Class
    -   Source Columns: Select both "Class 1" and "Class 2" from the dropdown menu.
-   In the source Handle Multiple source dropdown, select **Duplicate data**
